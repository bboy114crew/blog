## Overview
DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams. It emphasizes team empowerment, cross-team communication and collaboration, and technology automation.

DevOps is not a specific tool or technology. It is not a job title or a job description, and it is not a standalone practice that can be implemented in isolation.

### Why do we need DevOps?
DevOps aims to help organizations rapidly and reliably build and deploy software by automating and monitoring the process from end to end.

### What do we accomplish with DevOps?
By implementing DevOps practices, organizations can automate and monitor the process of software development from end to end, allowing teams to release and iterate on their products quickly and effectively.

### Who do we help with DevOps?
DevOps helps organizations and teams improve their ability to deliver value to their customers and users.

> DevOps standards are guidelines or best practices that organizations can follow to implement standards successfully. These standards typically cover areas such as communication, collaboration, and automation, and can help organizations to improve their software development process and deliver better products to their customers

### CI/CD
CI and CD are two acronyms frequently used in modern development practices and DevOps. CI stands for continuous integration, a fundamental DevOps best practice where developers frequently merge code changes into a central repository where automated builds and tests run. But CD can either mean continuous delivery or continuous deployment.

To put it simply continuous integration is part of both continuous delivery and continuous deployment. And continuous deployment is like continuous delivery, except that releases happen automatically.
